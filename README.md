Spatio Temporal Content Dissemination in Opportunistic Networks

A distributed mobile application in Android developed in Android Studio, on concepts of content dissemination in opportunistic networks, 
using Wi-Fi broadcasting and Location Services.
Used Location Services and device system time to broadcast emergency events/alerts in given STL (space-to-live) and TTL (time-to-live),
convenient for users within specific boundaries who intend to receive that data.
The java files contain the code that is useful for this project excluding the other details for the application.
